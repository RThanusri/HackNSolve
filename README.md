## Problem Statement

**Title** – An All-in-one healthcare platform for your needs, where you are a priority.

**Inspiration** - These pandemic times have taught us the importance of a remote healthcare system. Additionally rural areas currently do not have access to good healthcare systems. This has motivated us to build MedForHer.

## Features
* <b>Breast Cancer Detection tool :</b> Detects the presence of Metastatic Tissue and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma using two AI Models

## Technology Stack

### Artificial Intelligence & Web Technology

- Machine Learning
  - Python - Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow etc. for the ML Model(s)


  ## Machine Learning Tools

### Breast Cancer Prediction Tool

In order to detect cancer, a pathologist examines the slide of tissue under a microscope. S/he visually ensures that there's no cancer and ultimately find malignant areas. We currently provide a tool powered by artifical intelligence which analyses hispathological image i.e. images of glass tissue slides under a microscope, here tissue samples from lymph nodes in order to detect breast cancer. We will be analysing tissues for:

* **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** - This is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Almost 80% of diagnosed breast cancers are of this subtype.
* **Metastatic Cancer** - A metastatic cancer or metastatic tumor is one that has spread from the site where it started into different area/s of the body.

We  use the 'Breast Histopathology Images' dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection.

* **IDC_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.88
    * F1 Score: 0.88

* **Metastatic_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.94
    * F1 Score: 0.94
